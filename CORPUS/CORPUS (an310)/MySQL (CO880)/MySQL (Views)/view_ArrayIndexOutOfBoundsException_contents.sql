# The `User LifeTime` number designates the time-difference between the time that each individual subject user had
# opted-in to participate in Blackbox, until the time that this participant subject userâ€™s exception error occurred
# (was thrown). For example in initializing: `User LifeTime` = 0 | means that MySQL will return those Users whose
# error happened in the SAME day that they registered to Blackbox and the exception occured; `User LifeTime` = 1  
# means that MySQL will return those Users whose error happened ONE day after they registered to Blackbox and the
# exception occured; `User LifeTime` = 2 means that MySQL will return those Users whose error happened TWO days after
# they registered to Blackbox and the exception occured, and so on.
